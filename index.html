          <p>Hello!  I'm Katie and I love to code.  I have 14 years experience as a backend/full stack developer.  
            In my spare time I enjoy coding my own backend projects, playing video games, and spending time with my family.  
            I love virtual reality.  I have a passion for learning new technologies and I am always looking for new challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently working as a full stack developer at Alpha Baking.  I set up the company's GitHub repositories and created
            a document with instructions on how to use Git and GitHub and best practices.  I rewrote the company's auto vouchering system 
            that was originally written in Microsoft Access using React, React-Bootstrap, Python, Flask, and SQL Server.  I created a 
            Python application that imports data from Vorne XL machines and inserts it into our database using the machine's API.  I 
            also created PowerBI reports to display the data.  I created a Python application that imports data from 
            the UKG Pro API and syncs it with our databases and active directory.  I used KnowBe4's API to create and email 
            a report to management.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently working on upgrading the company to from SQL Server 2008 R2 to SQL Server 2022.  I am also 
            working on migrating other Microsoft Access applications to SQL Server.
          </p>
          <p>
            At home, I have been experimenting with Sleep Number's API to create a script to set the sleep numbers on the bed 
            and run it every hour to keep the bed at the desired settings from a Raspberry Pi.  I started creating a blog using Django.  
            I have also been working with Arduino.
